Due to several issues that SS.COM made in order to halt the service, I'm publishing the code as-is for anyone that is interested to re-use and create some similar service, or just scrape SS.COM for classifieds and information.

Everything put together here was made in less than 24 hours, so the code is messy and there is no documentation available, but if any questions occur - do not hesitate to create a new issue or contact me personally via hello[at]nils.digital.
